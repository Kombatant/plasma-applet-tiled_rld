# Tiled Menu Reloaded

A menu based on Windows 10's Start Menu. 

Forked from firefly's Tiled Menu (you can find it here: https://github.com/firefly75/plasma-applet-tiledmenu), which is a fork of zren's Tiled Menu (here: https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applet-tiledmenu). 

Using this as a playground to see how much I can fix/add just **by using LLMs** (kinda frustrating because they're dumb, but a learning experience nevertheless). **LLMs made far too many changes obviously for this fork to be any useful to the code it was forked from, hence the new branch.**

**Usable but STILL HAS BUGS so beware!**

* Supports:
    * Pin/Favourite apps/files through the context menu (or by dragging them from dolphin).
    * Resizing (permanently) the size of the menu.
    * Any size tile 1x1, 2x2, 4x4, 4x2, 1x3, etc.
    * Easily edit the background image of a tile.
    * Customizable sidebar shortcuts.
    * Jump to Letter/Category (can also default to this view)
    * Defaulting to only showing the tiles.
    * Labeling Groups of Tiles + Move Groups of Tiles + Sorting items in the group
